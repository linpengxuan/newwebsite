    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我想来介绍一下非严格意义的brainstorming。先是看到<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/roamlog/status/263132066235944962">这条推</a>，介绍了一个日本摄影师的网上
Gallery。点开后发现这个<a href="http://kogaeriko.com/01_asakusa/">网址</a>很精致，
这不正是我一直就想要的网站图集吗？很自然就产生了学习的兴趣。</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8334/8137524800_a4c60dea89.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p> 浏览的时候留意到了下面的代码标签，于是很自然地我就到了<a href="http://www.simpleviewer.net/products/">这儿</a>
。很好，提供免费的轻版本。稍微再挖掘下，我找到了适合我网站的<a href="http://www.juicebox.net/support/">代码</a>。支持Html5
，flickr，也可以免费正式使用。我实在找不到回头不找些时间去研究下这个东西的理由了，现在。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我一定还是有些怀旧的.洗澡的时候,莫名想起了大一丁克老师让我们做的一项性格测试.是的,在道德品德课上,没错,大学也得上的课,我就不提毛概邓论了.那种课里,一般都是放松的,交流气氛浓厚,传的都是诸如交大女生一回头之类在前推特时代以纸条方式进行交流的内容.我记得我们做了整整好几页的问答测试，我想这是我有记忆以来的首个心理测试，还好，我比较正常。接下来就给丁老师以上课的内容了。他就这个所谓黏液质，胆汁质之类的话能讲上好几堂课。我想这都是扯淡，人的性格怎么可能和身体的血液什么的挂上关系。我那时就把这个课题放到了脑袋里储存星座，算命等话题的同一群细胞里。虽然未受过正统的科学教育，我总持着一种对人之初，性本善这个观点的模糊支持，意思就是人生出来都是一样的，性格的不同完全就是环境的关系。</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8476/8127700862_9477660786_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>现在想起来，那些解释也有些道理。晚上在看the good wife时，提到的抗抑郁药就是一个例子。稍微深入想想，这药吃下去，肯定是对人体产生物理作用，何种方式我不清楚，可能作用在血液上，或是激素分泌上，刺激到脑袋里掌管喜乐的器官，从而间接起到控制抑郁的作用。我想人体的血液类型或许也有这样的作用，也就证明了开题所提到的测试的意义。血液里是不是有种--我不知道，仅为猜测--关系，比如A型血比B型血不同之处就在于它能多分泌出一些激素--再一次，我不知道是否正确使用激素这个词语，当我真正想表达的是一种能够刺激体内产生某种悲欢喜乐反应的物质--作用于脑中的器官，在足够长的时间上，我们可以排除白噪音和小概率事件的前提下，能观察或是回归出一种A型血类人和B型不同的性格。而这就极可能是测试背后的科学意义。</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8051/8127673451_93a51170e5_o.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>我无法确认正确与否，这是一种现象的小探讨。讲到这里，又想到另一个不相关的话题，中文和英文的语言逻辑。这还是从推里看到的。说是中文书写的特点完全就是意境型的，当我们把形容，修饰这些绿叶花草都拿掉，只看看剩下的骨干的时候，就只有一种感觉，这写的是什么东西。即使诸如新闻日报亦是如此，辩论时的不举出有利论据，仅是以各种不同的角度反复阐述观点，看似洋洋洒洒的千字文章，没有一句干货，而此类文字的目的仅有一个，作为宣传的手段。前段获诺奖时的新闻和再前段获诺奖时的新闻两种截然态度我们都是当做糗百来看的。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>以前过春节的时候，会非常期待。</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7149/6764103545_fc05e62c2d_z.jpg" width="214" height="240" title="fu_char" ></p>

<p>压岁钱超多，小时候每年基本不要零用钱，过年收的精打细算总是能刚好花上一年。我记得做过一个chart，标记上每年压岁钱的额度，于是就出来了一个斜率有45度的向上曲线。这待遇最终传给我妹妹，从二零某几年开始，在刚刚hit到万元大关后，我就收不到压岁钱了。</p>

<p>爆竹应该也是春节的象征吧。乡下地方，鞭炮放起来不要命。以年初一作为顶点，过年气氛可以按照前后的时间轴做个正态分布。烟雾也是类似，到那几天整个空气中总是弥漫着一股硫磺的味道，闭上眼睛二战老兵也仿佛回到了绞肉场上。我们家03年搬到厦门后，渐渐地，这个鞭炮也慢慢给文明城市给禁了。今年更夸张，如果我耳朵没有问题的话，我从来没有听到过声音。想我当年是10块钱买一串二踢脚，用手拿着，拿香点着，嗖一下飞出。好玩还能证明勇气，当然，我现在已经不敢了。我超级惜命。<!--more--></p>

<p>那过春节剩下的一个理由就是全家人聚在一起。确实都在厦门，无奈聚不到一起，前几篇有提到原因。于是春节对我来说，就变成一个很好的理由请假，回家躺在床上，从头到尾没出过门的经历了。没有任何经历的春节应该也是一个经历吧。</p>

<p>说说以前春节都会干的事情吧。我会拼命给所有的朋友发短信拜年，nokia手机以前的群发功能只有在春节时才会大派用场，我感觉这时候才有个很好的理由给即使只是见过一面的人发上一条短信，完了还不会觉得不好意思的机会。可惜哥现在不搞这个，原因简单，短信拜年没劲，不对，拜年本身就没劲。不给兄弟发短信的原因是，这么熟了不用发；不给普通朋友发短信的原因是，不是很熟不用发。这世界用如此简单的二分法分开的一个结果是，我开始感觉到我已经渐渐地和我以前熟悉的世界远离了。</p>

<p>过年还得狠吃狂喝。在沙县就是意味着有吃不完的板鸭和用脸盆端上的鸡肉。以前碰到好吃的东西，我会不停地吃，即使打到饱嗝也在所不惜，没事，不就小休息一下，肚子有点撑吗？套句话来说是肚子饱了，嘴巴没饱。而现在，完全没有欲望去吃了。我今年已算30，明显感觉到身体变差了。稍微多吃些，胃就撑得难受了。所以当我说，我吃饱了，还真吃不了更多，他们放佛看到了一个陌生人，毕竟我以前的名声已经留下了深深的烙印，那是在一个即使女生手里嵌着馅饼，我都能伸嘴过去吃一口的年代，果然时间改变一切。</p>

<p>春节有如例行公事般，公司配合，到这个时节催促我们请多两天假，我们照例无视狂涨的机票价格，将平常待的地方挪个窝，过着衣来伸手饭来张口的神仙日子。我心里知道不对，该做些什么，却无从下手。也许改变应该从下个春节做起，比如在地球某个角落facetime给家里拜年。我考虑过，只是这次还真来不及，去澳洲机票不对头，去台湾签证来不及。春节还是老样子，看现在的小孩的兴奋感，自己也曾走过来，现在人变了，没错，很明显的是人变胖了，感觉也就跟着变了。我的心态变了。已经开始自认有轻微抑郁症的人最近被朋友笑称也有强迫症，心态上已经完全。。。跟不上节奏，最重要的体现是对太多东西无所谓，大约中学阶段那几句对自己不停重复的话已经开始结果了，“不以物喜，不以己悲”；“无欲则刚”。就连春节都不期待，对和父母见面不期待，对购物没兴趣。我必须培养出兴趣，在无聊完全吞噬我之前。必须。</p>

<p>又是乱写了些文字，还是那句老话，博客基本是自言自语，也没打算坐到多少的PV，只是给自己一个素材，这样老了后还能看看，有点乐子，或是多些写回忆录的素材。</p>

<p>很开心这次老范全家过来厦门过年。他们家小狗精力旺盛，在过年期间，给我们留下了深刻的印象。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t even remember when it was the last time I wrote the blog in
English. I would like to write on something about how I made it through
this awful 2011.</p>

<h4>what I did?</h4>

<ul>
<li>I didn’t attend language school for Korean improvement; and I didn't work
hard at this. There is no such thing as if only I could turn back time.</li>
<li>Married on March 19, 2011.</li>
<li>Found a not-too-bad job in Korea. Frankly, I got paid handsomely at my
last job with less working pressure.</li>
<li>Read books. Well, not only from <a href="http://qidian.com">起点</a>. With my kindle,
I convinced myself that I like reading.</li>
<li>Proudly to open an <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>blog at <a href="http://colors4.us">colors4.us</a> along with my wife.</li>
<li>Get a job for wife. Serendipity.</li>
<li>Finally to receive my PHD degree, taking one year and a half more time,
expecting all the paperwork be done in coming two months.</li>
<li>We got baptized.<!--more--></li>
</ul>


<h4>some thoughts</h4>

<p>The good thing is I have plans, the bad thing is plenty of them. Certainly
life is too short for all of them.</p>

<p>Like Obama said, changes that we need. I think if I don't do this in 2012,
I wouldn't be able to do it at all for the rest of my life.</p>

<ul>
<li>Be able to stay focus.</li>
<li>Be stable, so I could have my desire for materials controlled.</li>
</ul>


<h4>letter from past</h4>

<p>I received a letter writing to future me exactly one year before.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Dear Future Me,</p></p><p><p>Sitting at my girlfriend Dong Ping's room, having done my nose<br/>surgery..seems good...might marry her..</p></p><p><p>What do you think? Still thinking of working together in Korea? Hope I<br/>could get well.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>turned out to me, so far so good, at least for my nose and the marriage.</p>

<h4>meeting with my father</h4>

<p>The first thing I have to do every time I reach home is to meet my father,
so I went to see my father on this Dec 29th of lunar calendar year of
Rabbit. He is doing his time for embezzling allegation; basically he still
has 2 more years ahead if the expecting parole goes well.</p>

<p>It is a funny feeling because for me it is a once per year event, with it
slots at spring festival annually, the only chance I am able to be home.</p>

<p>I don't really have a lot to talk with my parents; I ascribe this to the
generation gap. We seldom talk in any time of my life; they seemed to be
busy all my life. So except the monetary support from them, which I feel so
grateful about, they don't have words in any decisions I made. I think I am
still mad at him, not 100 percent sure though. It is not that his
imprisonment brings shame to our family, quite contrast, I found it a good
way to see what people would think of inmate when come to their own friends
or relatives. The reason is quite simple, I offered him an exit, he didn't
take it and he didn't take the responsibility as a father when family
needed him most, quite opposite by what his doing.</p>

<p>We stayed in the meeting room. My dad is eating foods we brought to him. My
mom has prepared a lot to eat. Father looked quite busy during the meeting,
he had to have the chicken soup and talked with us, with a Chunghwa
cigarette in his fingers. Everyone is sitting at the chair, except me
standing beside them. I explained to them that I don't want to feel cold by
sitting down, it is not in fact, I tried to pose a stance to tell them, can
I leave first, I was quite sleepy (sorry to say this, but I had a red eye
flight last night).</p>

<p>He has not been in the family since Oct 2007. I felt that could be the
hardest time ever to me. For common practice, Chinese govt. tends to have
the couple of questioned official seizure at the same time. So my mom also
was gone for a 4 or 5 months time. My sister was 9 years old then; I just
started my PHD program in Xiamen University. It is in such moments that
Murphy's Law works quite well. Couple months later, my grandmother has
realized that she was kept being told the forgery reason of the absence of
father. She refused to take on medical cares for her later period of
diabetes. She left with regret not being able to see his son. Trying to
prove its own mercy, Govt. arranged father to see her dead body before
cremation. I don't quite understood what this was all about.</p>

<p>As inmate, Father has shaved his hair bold. I found him had adjusted quite
well, might even lost some weight, which is a lot better than before. When
meeting came end, he was escorted back by police. I can read his mind at
that time because he kept waving to us every two or three steps forward. He
tried to tell us we should be healthy and happy, he was quite sure about
the parole things too, we don't need to be worried.</p>

<p>I read you, and I forgive you, Dad.</p>

<h4>last but not the least</h4>

<p>Every once a while, I would start pondering the meaning of life. Quite
sure, I am not satisfied with answers by Siri. I would ask myself why
people feel angry, scare or sad. Of course I don't think I know it.
However, even by starting to question so, I was assured some edges. I
would've felt that I am not me anymore but someone else. All of sudden, I
would not fear death. Certainly I back to normal.</p>

<p>I am proudly to be what I am now. :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am prond to annouce a newly opened colume, sudden thought. in this section,
i will write down all those things suddenly come into my minds but will soon
disappear without a trace if, i don't make a note.</p>

<p>today's about breaking power into monopoly.</p>

<p>people talk about monopoly, some of them would come with Microsoft, indeed. it
is a monopoly company in IT. but if we observe the history more carefully, MS
itself is either one of the piorneer to break the monopoly by IBM at early
times or the one to defend its monopoly, it just keeps changing roles all the
time.</p>

<p>this is not what i about to say. I want to say, behold, fear not to the
monopoly. in 1995, when Navigator is all around the WWW, MS broke its monopoly
by integrating IE into Windows. also, when IE takes the share of browser
market by 98%, here comes the Firefox( the one i am using now, those who are
using IE are those who havn't discover the good deeds and conviniece of FF,
and those who are using FF are those who have used IE), in a very short time,
it just takes up its number over 10%.</p>

<p>let us move to search engine. before google came into being, it is dominated
by Yahoo, thought it still does now but with less shares. just like days past,
people change their habits and move into the arms of google, also they put the
last nails on the coffin of those fail to evolve, who are very good examples
of bad things about monopoly, it just makes u stop.</p>

<p>monopoly itself is nothing more than a number, a status, something usual, if
we can go up with ideas, put them into reality and make them believe it would
be stupid if they don't use them...</p>

<p>idea would be most important. make it real. knows what customers really want
by doing some role-changing or polls.</p>
