  <h1>About Us</h1>
<p>My wife <a href="http://twitter.com/sourrabbit">@sourrabbit</a> and I <a href="http://twitter.com/linpx">@linpx</a> are the only authors contributing to this blog. We believe life is a book, from which all those good and bad, happy and sad things are written. We commit to keep this blog up, for the memories of the past as well as the colors in our life.<a href="http://www.colors4.us/about-us/index.html">...</a></p>
