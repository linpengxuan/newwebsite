everything comes for a reason. So does everything done by him. what I am
trying to say is, he is elected at least by a big margin over John Kerry in a
country regarded as most democratic place, there are no reasons he was an
ass*** as we have ever thought. Last year, I met two Americans, One is young
,the other old. Young one voted for Kerry, the old guy trusted in Bush. what
if he was right? what are the reasons behind that almost conservitive
Americans love him? that comes the last line of my blog, I am not biased. for
me, I lived in a communist country where trying to embrace the capitalism
without changing its own political system, there weren't enough or impartial
material for us to comprehend the world, in other words, we were raised with
presumptions.Â  on the other hand, think about regime under Saddem Hussein,
people tortured to death, for more servere in the Prison Gate taking place
nowadays. they didn't find WMD there doesn't mean Saddam hadn't that thoughts.
I am trying to ask all the parties involved to calm down and adopt a more
peaceful way to solve the problem,but unfortunetly, we are human beings, a
creature dying for fighting and competing.
