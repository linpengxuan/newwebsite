A Humble Heart By A. Oakley Stirring in her soul, is this child's silent
desire. She prays with a humble heart, setting her soul on fire. Turning to
God with her eyes fixed on heaven, She begins her talk with God, though she's
only seven. You see her kneeling there With her head bowed down in prayer. She
asks God for forgiveness of sins And that He would protect her, and all of her
kin. She prays for the pony that she always has dreamed of Then praised God
for sending His love. As she finishes, she thanks God for another day. Only if
those older would pray this way; With a clear mind and a humble heart Praise
God that your soul from Him can never depart.
