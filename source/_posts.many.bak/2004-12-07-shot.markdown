Get frustrated in learning English and studying the law.


Let me tell you something. You never find your right way to do that. That can
explain why you don’t see any improvement in yourself.


So you get frustrated, you hate to learn, you hate to do everything that
relates to it.


But you know, at least, you know something. Among all the ways that can
achieve the goals, at least there is one way you already know is impractical.


See, you learn something. Why not keep on trying. Because you will do less.


Either give your best shot, or don’t come up with a trying.
