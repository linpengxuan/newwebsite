Potential rules

There are potential rules everywhere in any field one can imagine. Ok, the
rule is like this. Everyone knows there is a circle in which elite can make a
lot of something what they think precious. But the first step is you have to
know how to get in the circle. How. No one will tell you. It is all depending
on yourself. You have to find a way out. As long as one get into this circle,
ok, very prudently, this guy will still keep the way to get in circle a secret
as any other guy in the same circle does.

This is the potential rules. You know it, you donâ€™t tell it.
