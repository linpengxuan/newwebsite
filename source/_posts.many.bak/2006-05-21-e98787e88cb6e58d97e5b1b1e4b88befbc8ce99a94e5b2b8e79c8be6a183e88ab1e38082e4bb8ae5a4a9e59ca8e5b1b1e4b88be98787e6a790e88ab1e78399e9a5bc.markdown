最近更新很少，是因为写得东西少。没东西上传了，就把刚写的DISSERTATION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT放上吧。

  
  

One of the greatest things I learned from TLBU in the past 2 years is knowing
how to be grateful for everything I used to take granted for. Indeed, from
this prospective, the first person I truly and sincerely respect and express
my gratitude to is my President, Dr. LYOU Byunghwa, for he not only shows me
the vastness of his International legal expertise and knowledge, guiding me
into the right track on academic performance, moreover, the love bestowed on
me with a vision as a successful elder.

  

Also, I wouldn’t forget all the other faculty members in TLBU, Prof. John Lee,
Prof. Choe, Prof. Kim, Prof. Thomas, and Prof. Hong, I wouldn’t be lead into
this legal majestic hall were not for the help from all of them. Thanks.

  

I also am glad to meet a lot more friends here, thanks to you guys for
bringing me laughters and sharing things with me. The end of June, 2006 marks
the time we departed from each other, also starts an era of lifetime
friendships among us.

  

Last but not the least, thanks to my beloved parents, for everything you have
done to me, and for spoiling me all the time, for adopting my little sister.
