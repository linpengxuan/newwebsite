Sunny day, though cold. They left, some for China, some Pusan, wawo, seems as
if we are the king of the school now, eh, things could not be better yeah, you
are right, party tonight. The first day ever I got up at 10:50 after saw them
off, damn it, feel good. I am lazy, so nothing is expected to be done during
He's absence. Then I get bored. What can I do to kill time? To kill myself,
not bad an idea, and not now. I wrapped my ass off the bed, staring in the
mirror with my Ray Ban for a long time, perfect. Satisfied, I figured out why
not make it a little bit more perfect. So today's tip of free is shining your
shoes, taking your one-month-not-washed jeans to laudary. Believe me, my
friend, that is nice.

  

Also, my pick today is Dixie chicks's cold day in July.
