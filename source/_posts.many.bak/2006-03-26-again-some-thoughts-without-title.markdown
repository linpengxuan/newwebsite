some scractch, not even nealy related to a blog.

  
things suddenly came into my mind after I watched the Dix commendament and
finishing the mass.

  
sound track of the Lion King and prince of egypt.

  
:harsh now, my baby, don't cry. sleeping remember my last lullaby so...rivers,
rivers floated gently for me, do you know someone he can be free, river.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhh............: things were so beautiful

  
also I am downloading the prince of egypt now, to see if anything changes on
the views regarding Moses between Hollywood in 70s and in 90s....

  
also, last thing, V for Vendette is really nice. please let me know if you
want to go to cinema with me next week..... it depicted a world of year 2000
as if the Nazis won the 2nd world war...interesting, isn't that?

  
"have mercy....."

  
"not tonight!"
