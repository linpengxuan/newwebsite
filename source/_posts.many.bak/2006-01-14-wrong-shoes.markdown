me and guodong patronized a same pair of shoes. I woke up this morning,
thinking about walking back to campus town, and got my shoes. and I found
something were different, they were much cleaner. now that must belong to
Guodong. when it comes to the whereabout of mine, I need to say no more.

  
his response is yesterday I found out, the feeling is a little bit different.
