I am not good at talking, so when he tried to preach something to me, the best
thing is to keep silent, and pretend all he said was right. Even though he
made it right by an authoritarian way, somehow I still have an complex to
fight against his words yet foresee an already-known answer, he is not that
easily changed.

I prepared many sounding reasons for him, all of which I can't even start a
word. It is not that I lost my confidence, but I found, as usual, all the
effort I made, am making would be in vain. In other words, the struggle is
meaningless, whose only result makes him feel you are not serious enough.
Fine. I had better shut up!

However, again, he changed my mind. I hate to say that I am the straw blowing
in the wind, but not an eagle there is something for sure. I tried to explain
what I want to be after that, but I found I lost myself in an empty space,
didn't know what to say. Do I really want to take that position there? Ask
myself. The instinct answer would be No! And the second one if asked again is
of course not. Now, he said my favorite working place is somewhere bigger and
I have already lost my confidence. I did lost my confidence on finding a job
especially I can't arrange an interview with them or get refusal time and time
again. But this confidence is not necessary in need for me, Or this kind of
confidence. What I need is what I have now, so don't worry about that!

Don't make the same mistake twice. So, I guess he is right, a second
time!![](/rte/emoticons/lightbulb.gif)![](/rte/emoticons/lightbulb.gif)
