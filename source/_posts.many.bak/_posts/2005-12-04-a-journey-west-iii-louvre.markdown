今天爽了卢浮宫。

  

Musee de Louvre 多熟悉的名字，多遥远的地方，而我一个中国学生能够有幸一览其风采，what more could i say, I am
already much luckier than most of chineses on this earth.

  

When I came to Louvre, the first thing pop up on mind is Mona Lisa, not just
because of Don Brown's novel, but from other sources. A famous masterpiece, by
Leonardo De Vinci, is regarded as one of the most important collections in
Louvre and indeed its treatment in Louvre is worthy mentioning, no photo, no
video, a two layer glasses box, which I believe a voltage high enough to kill
a cow and bulletproof features might not still rest the curator's heart, that
is why I was asked to stop taping once I took my DV out by a sudden-appear
employee.

  

I told someone in Group1, Mona Lisa is famous over the world by most of the
people around the world, and I was then standing in front of her, enjoying her
tranquility and smoothness style, amazing then painting technique, and paying
my worship to Leonardo as well. That is what I would say. I am not inheriting
an artist mind, I am not knowing what is art, but I was standing just in front
of her, in front of something known by everyone. That already raised me to a
new level, and it did.

  

Thank god.

  

然后是维纳斯雕像，斯芬克司，汉默拉比法典，天哪，我真的不能相信自己能够亲眼看到这些真真实实存在我面前的东西，甚至只要一伸手就能够碰到这些影响，见证人类历史长
河进程的事物。

  

然后当我想起，这里的数以千计的艺术品至少都有几百年的历史时，我已默然。诚然，我们讨厌帝国主义侵略，抢夺了我们的文化遗产，可是没有他们，谁又能保证这些东西能够
重见天日，谁又能保证这些不会被某些人拿来当碗刷，当瓢用，或是谁又能保证不会出现余秋雨书中的那个老道，只已些许的价值卖出，却仍感觉赚到。
