To my beautiful Korea friends,


We arrived in TLBU, after a two-day trip to Pusan, in which, we spent 1 day
and a half sitting on the bus, with nothing to do but wait.


But, it is still worthy. We met new friends, didn’t we? So again, very nice
and happy to meet you, lady. For me, kind of precious experience, you know,
walking in the beach, dancing machine, enjoying the ice-cream, taking photos.


May this good memory could, at least, last for a long time.


Ps: 1, pls don’t be hesitate to write to me, you are my first Korea friend of
the same age.

2, if photos we took are available, please mail them as attachment to
following email:
