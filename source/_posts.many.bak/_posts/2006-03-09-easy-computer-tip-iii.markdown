go to [www.pandora.com](http://www.pandora.com) for the online music playing.

  
the amazing thing is you can choose the singer or the song, then leave the
rest to the website, it will automatically generating a playlist in which
similar songs will be played.

  
1, for killing time.

2, for someone who is boring.

3, it is all but a flash requiring nothing to install

  
advanced user would like to check the bulletin board of US music or apple's
itune for the name of the latest popular songs
