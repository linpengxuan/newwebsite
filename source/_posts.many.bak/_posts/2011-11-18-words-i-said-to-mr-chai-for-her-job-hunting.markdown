과장님, my Korean is not good enough to explain this. But could you spare me a
minute by reading this regarding Dong’s job hunting.

We are very grateful that you gave us this chance. She gave up her own job in
China, flew all the way here to support me. But she and I both know that given
her ability in Korean, unless she is exposed to Korean speaking environment,
she would never be able to find a satisfied job, that is why Dong really
cherish this opportunities.

She keeps do all the research on the bond market in China and south Asia for
days. And I can assure you that she is the smartest girl even in China,
because the law degree in Peking University is the most difficult one to
obtain.

As I can feel, that your concerns might be her Korean ability. Believe me, I
am about the same level as her when I enter into Shinhan (6 months of Korean
studying), I couldn’t understand what my colleagues said. But I think I cope
with it better after 6 months. So please, if you don’t mind, help us in this.
