Test again, what the hell is wrong with Microsoft hotmail. It has two choice,
either let me use it or not, donâ€™t just keep changing your policy. I am sick
and tired of that.

when it becomes a habit for me to attend the Mass every Sunday morning, i just
feel can't escape from a regular life like this, not because i am so devout to
kneel before the lord. but deep inside, i am still searching my faith.
apparently, so far, no result.
