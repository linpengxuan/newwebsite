1, I went to Picaddily for King kong. alone means there was only me. you
believe that, the conductor asked me to buy two tickets as if she have been
acuitance to me for a long time. I want to kill myself, for people around me
were in couple.

2, ever imagineÂ  a monkey fighting with 3 dogs. well, if u did. then, you are
in the right track, King kong faught with 3 dinosaurs, which were last seen in
the jurrusic park, the most bloody, deadest ones.

3, Peter Jackson is making a movie as if an animation. you are totally astoned
by the incredable movements in the movie, maybe same as Tom and Jerry, the
only differences are one from people, one pictures.

4, Noami Watts is a rising star, who I really take as would be famous as next
Nicole Kidman. She acts so successfully in Molholland Drive, being an actrees
seeking for autions everywhere and hoping her hollywood dream come true, while
fighting with her own illusion, in which she fell love with another girl in
spot, lesbian.

5, I nearly cried at the end of the movie. this is a reason good enough to be
put in the top 250 list.
