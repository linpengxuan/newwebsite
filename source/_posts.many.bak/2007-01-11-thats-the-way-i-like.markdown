**_and this is my reply, _**

MY dear, how lovely you are. And u know how much I want to c u right here and
right at this time, to let u know I do want to c what u would be when a heavy
fist punch in your face.

I made 20,000 dollars last month, and lost all of it this week. Now u c how
mad I am today. Shit...(with a lot of beeps following....)

Well, before I left TLBU, I only know how camp means to school, now I do have
a better understanding when this come to influence person. Obviously, you are
not exceptional. So, hey, sister, what are u talking about? My English, F**k
that, better than native...my adopted sister, hey, who r u? my lovelife, shit,
... Indeed, there is someone approaching to me today, ......

But u r good at writing, according to my classmate Both's saying, shit! Hey, u
r not only trying to follow me, but also, did a very good job in simulating
the way I talk and write. And I appreciate that, u weighs more in my heart,
physically!

PS, allow me to post it blog, for dam long a time, haven't written any words
in English.

Ur so called adopted sister's bro.
