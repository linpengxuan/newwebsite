But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear
with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and
everything done in it will be laid bare. Since everything will be destroyed in
this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to

live holy and godly lives
