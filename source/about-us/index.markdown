*	We married on March 19, 2011.
*	We are now living in Seoul. We might move to somewhere else in future.
*	We always want to experience something new. The world is too big to explore, yet we are running out of time.
*	We are Chinese, currently are learning Korean and French. New languages, popular or small, always inspire us new concepts, that there always are a lot things we know we don't know and we love to know.
