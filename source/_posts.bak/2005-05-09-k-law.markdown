Just finish my contract law course. Feeling could not be greater, for I could
answer the Professor Choi’s questions, or something else, I am not sure. But
what I convinced is that I broke the shadow between us. Meaning, an immerging
problem always obsess me when no one raise his hand to answer his not-that-
hard question after he travels one hour and a half to reach here and starts to
say that I feel no sympathy to those person who ask me to pick him while here
are your chances, and you don’t treasure them. I am one of those persons. That
is me when he says so. God, I failed him. But I will not since I made up my
mind, to prepare all the cases in the book.

Things seem to go well, but I am not sure. Still, the LSAT is like a big tree
falling down in front of my way ahead.
