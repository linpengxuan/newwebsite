A sudden thought----- go marathoning.

Retropecting on my life before, I never really challenge myself, never
challenge myself truly, self-voluntarily, confidently. Besides the LSAT,
suddenly, I decide to MARATHON.

Yeah, marathon.

When I get old, I would say to myself, hey, man, you can do something that
most of human beings can’t. Wow, that would be attractive, wouldn’t it?
