one of the very best things in this trip is that, u don't know where to go at
when, and who u will meet on the roads...


so last time when I am in Ha Noi, it really did feel like home, yet that means
losing the beauty of meeting new friends coming from the rest of the world.
now I did on my own in the trip from Hanoi to HCM city. it was like,
great...couldn't describe the exactly feeling about this.


i met a lot new friends. like, just came across with a girl from Indonesian,
she taught me how to take good fotos and that makes me feel i am talented in
taking fotos, met a guy from Ireland, we talked about the confict between
Sinnfin and Britain Govt, met a couple from France on why they don't always
speak good English as Germany or Nederlanders do. met an Argetina guy, we
talked about why every westerner carries a Lonely Planet. help a girl from
Japan to find her hotel in a place i am not familiar with too...


things like those...some even suggest me just spend 20 days in Hanoi
purposelessly and doing nothing bcoz it is beautiful, living in a dorm for 1
dollar a day, i will discover a lot more new things.


so traveling here is like, i was shown to a whole new world i never really
thought of b4. and i am very much like to keep on trying. for me, i got
invited by Local Vietnamese to take mud bath in Nha Trang,some other invited
me to sun bath in beautiful beach, i decided to take the snorkering and diving
course, after all, it cost 6 dollars for 1 day trip and i got sunburnt
yesterday, itchy and red all over my body.....haha
