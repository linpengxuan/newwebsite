**2 _Jackass Number Two_ (Jeff Tremaine)** Playing on more than three thousand screens, _Jackass 2_ was the number-one-grossing movie in America on its opening weekend—and the male stars eat shit and drink horse semen for real. They're nude a lot, too. If this isn't cultural terrorism, I don't know what is.

What above mentioned is a movie I watched along with Borat last month. I
couldn't say it isn't unique, from a very very special perpective. I mean, if
u never felt like to vomit during a movie, well, this is your chance. For me.
It just dammit grossy. Ewl…….

I still remembered that night, I just directly closed the movie after it was
played on for 10 minutes. After that, I sat on my bed for another 10, with
unrestrained curiosity, I opened the prog to watch it again to see how bad
one's imagination could be, I have to tell you, they beat me in my face.

Also the Borat, the film was rated was one of the best in 2006 by Time. Won't
say something more, but to cite one or two spots, in case u wonder what movie
is this.

In the first secene, he introduced his family members to us, the audience (it
is a quasi-documentary). Then he went to a woman, not bad looking, he kissed
her for a long time, trust me, a long time, so when everybody thought that
could be his wife, he just turned around, introduced the one he just kissed
was his sister…ewll….shit……..

The other scence, he visit a rodeo ground, said sth like these, we khazak
totally on the side of President Bush on his war on terro, u know, those
places really like ones in Texas, they are conservatives, they support Bush,
so they just applauded when they heard this, and then after another long and
dulling talk, Borat suggested to sing the national Anthem altogether. No one
would say no, so he started first…. With his Khazakistan anthem

Gosh, u just don't know how funny could that be!
