DH is not bad a TV show. People might wonder why all those radiculous but tiny
small and impressive goodies could all happen in a short time in a typical
American White Community. Let alone for the sake of TV, I found it interesting
for it presents to me the virtues and views about what American Middle Class
think about the  world, it should be selfishlessness to urge and supervise
other guys obey not only the community laws but moreover a serias standards of
moralities, which root from its Americanism and Christianity; and vicious,
somewhat depressed, even desperate when it comes to deal with its own good.

  
never thought about killing people is so fun a thing in desperate housewife,
they even dubbed with a funny background music. remember how W. George tried
to murder Dr. Goldfine in a bridge just for resentfulness about Dr's advice to
Mrs Van De Kamp

woman: why are all rich men jerks?

man: same reason all beautiful woman are bitches.

  
  
the woman is giving us her baby, Gaby, we kiss whatever needed to be kissing

  
  
PS: also I never think of someone who are popular just because of their own
selfishness.

I hate you.  you know what, the opposite of hate is not love, is indifference,
if you hate me, that means you still care about me, and we are still
connected.

  
PS: the role of red hair beauty Mrs Bree Van De Kamp gives us all the pet
peeves and annoyance an American family could ever enjoy. and believe me, my
friend, the early dating experience of the teenager sons and daughters is only
the last thing they need to worry about. look, How elegant one could be when
even holding a gun!

among all the charaters, Edie Britt and Lynette are my favourite. Edie is
smart, knows what she need and stick to her own principles, reminds me someone
I knew. Lynette is smarter, knows how to get what she wants without bothering
other by introducing some tactics, which also adds more fun parts to DH.
