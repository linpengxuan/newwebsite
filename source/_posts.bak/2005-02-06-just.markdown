Suddenly, I found myself totally in a place. A place I have never been before.
The strangeness start to cover me. My toe, my foot, my leg, then is the waist,
chest, till my head completely fell into the shadow. I can feel nothing but
fear.

What can I do? When the feeling ebbs off, it is weird that I have my eyes that
can’t see, my mouth can’t shout, my nose can’t smell, my finger can’t touch,
my tongue can’t taste. All the 5 basic feelings are deprived from me by
someone I don’t care, without leaving any clue. It seems that I just was born
in that way.

Then a light in the tunnel shines all over the dark space, I sensed it. And
cramped footsteps were sensed. Everything in the flow of time seems to be
normal but me……..

Forget about this dream.
