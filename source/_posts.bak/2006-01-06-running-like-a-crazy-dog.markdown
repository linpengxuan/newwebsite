running like a crazy dog!

  

I am not a person boasting the ability of self-control or discipline. however,
Jogging is an exceptional. when asked why now, why in cold winter days. I gave
them fake answers, say, have some reasons to buy new clothes, on diet, keep
myself fit, it is cool or it is cold (not even sounds reasonable). but in
fact, I don't need reasons for jogging. it to me like food and water to human
body, yes, I addict to it, incredibly.

  

every two days, I have my regular clothes changed into my set, my running set.
then run, run, run, run like Forrest Gump, run like a crazy dog. I don't even
need to know where to end, for the course itself make me feel high enough.

  

And I know I can make it, with courage and efforts.
