Easy your computer

  
tips 2,

  
People always want to find things free in Internet, things don't come free.
however, sometime rules are broken.

  
sometimes is this time. I am so proud to present to you the highly popular
photo sharing website. [www.flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com)

  
which you can upload your foto, keep the original size and share with your
friends, also it provides pic host that means,

u can use fotos there in your MSN blog (check the tip I).

  
besides these, this website is a damn good place for you to find wallpapers.
close to life yet without losing the sense on art....

  
if u do, add me as your contact...my logging name is linpengxuan

  
if you are using free account, you are limited with 200 pics, after that, the
old ones will be gone in your page but actually still existed, u just lost its
address. but you are with Linpengxuan, don't worry about that, go to this
site, search your name, look what surprise you can get.
