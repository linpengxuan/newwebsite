 an email from Pumpkin. but my question is since when I lost my right to
express my unconfortable feeling in front of any body, especailly some
friends. and you don't even need to add a haha at the end of this letter for
god's sake, it won't do it any good. my feeling is I have had enough this kind
of talk, now that was something what really unconforts me.

btw，我早以在心中放下了这件事，你还一直提起，不知到底是谁的心里出了问题。

  
无欲则刚。
