What can i say? She finally made it...haha.I am so happy for her. The only
regret was that I broke my words, I told her I would be there when my dear
sister marries hmm, years ago and have these words confirmed again months b4.
I didn't fly to her hometown(as i recalled, somewhere in an island far far
away from here). For one thing, working load is heavy; Second, something
happened here...

  
So one of my friends married, who will be next? Would that be you...Certainly
not me...
