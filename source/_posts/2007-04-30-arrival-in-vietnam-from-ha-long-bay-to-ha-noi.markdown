Finanlly, without knowing a word of Vietnamese, I came through the port,
reached the soil of Vietnam. some ppl can speak Chinese...


I took a bus to Ha Long Bay, no one speaks Chinese there. i have to show them
the destination I want to go. all the 4 hrs, i sat and put, without doing
anything, only to find the driver is way too much brave to have a speed more
than 70 km per hr in a rainy day...shit.. i have bought myself the insurance,
comforting myself.


then i met with my dear Senior Phong, the first thing is to hug him. no words
could descripe that feeling after a 1000 km travle in 14 hrs. and his wife, my
classmate Quynh.


will say more when i could type Chinese....


a word. after meeting them, i never felt i was in a foreign country, just felt
like home. i am home now, with my bros and sisters.....

i am now on my trip to Nha Trang, a town has nothing but only blue sky and
beautiful beaches, where I will learn how to dive and kiss the coral reef....


met a lot of new friends, nice talk and begin to fall in love with taking
pictures, will host a pix show later when i return to China, for that, i guess
will take longer time, because i still have two countries to visit, combodia
and Laos....haha


bu ai xian.
