last time i play basketball in yongsei university in korea. what i learnt
there is the way korea guys play.

1, they are very polite. you seldom see them disputing. and they say thank u
to each other when finish one game.

2, they are more professional. maybe their individual ability could not match,
but they play in teams. you got to love to play with them.
