tomorrow it would be Jan 1st. again. shit. since when I lost my feeling about
the coming new year, I don't know. or too many jan 1sts have diluted me in an
era of rest.

anyway, I should be happy. I didn't die, I guess this could be one of not-too-
many things I might celebrate. you don't know how dangerous it could be when I
run on the icy roads, hoping those cars not going to hit me half dead or full.
either way poses a common on my way.

movies say how a man treat his own car shows how a man treat himself. I agree.
in this cold, dark winter days, I am going to give me something special!
