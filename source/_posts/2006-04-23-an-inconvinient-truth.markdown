think about it. when everyone round us is busying making money or thinking how
to make money. the place where we have lived on for centuries is no longer
what we perceived before. I overheard some saying, ten ever hottest year in
human's history ever record is the last ten years with 2005 its peak. what are
we going to do to save oursleves and our's generation if we are not that
selfish. a moment at stake could hardly be more elusive. it is up to you, or
up to me?!

  
It is only take you a little bit effort to protect our Earth, and ourself.

a not too bad movie was presented to you. [an incovinient truth](http://www.ap
ple.com/trailers/paramount_classics/aninconvenienttruth/trailer/).

  
also another documentary movies shows how cheap democracy was when it
confronts the superpower: a road to guantanamo. and show us things actually
and always are not what we think used to be.

you might think him is regretting, confessing. but it is not. take a look at
this movie, it won't take you long, it will make you reconsider the power of
muslim. shudder you at the first thought.
