High days recently. Got to do a lot of things, yet always complain about
elapsing of time.

Little tricky and stupid.

Last time, I went out for shopping. It is so amazing to me that actually there
are a lot of goods I think worthy to buy which I never had that kind of
feeling in china, also the same reason why I have clothes dated 3 or 4 years
ago. It is not just I don’t want to buy new ones there, but for lack of
attracts. Be afraid of my does-not working card, I check my payment in a fast
food, and it worked. Encouraging from that, I told myself, seems that I am
going to spend a lot, haha. I am not kind of person who is so stringent yet
nor those spend a lot without logic, I just want to spend it and enjoy the way
I spend it. With next consecutive 20 trying to use my credit card, all failed.
Damn, so destructive. I should’ve known that before. But just kind of hoping
it would work.

It is ok. Everytime I went into a new shop, tried to wear the most suitable
clothes in front of mirror, thinking that I could be that handsome, and I even
never noticed that before. When checking, I pretended to buy them and asked
the staff to use my credit card, and then pretended to be so sorry for’em cos
I couldn’t buy’em.

Vanity is original sin, isn’t it?
