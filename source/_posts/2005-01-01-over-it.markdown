Finally, I am over it.

With my striving yesterday, 3 parties in last day of 2004 come my new year
2005.

What more could I say. Nothing but Happy New Year and screaming to death.

We dance in a most conservative university in the world.

Secretly.

With the friends from Canada, Australia and U.S.

Also our drama receives great success among those kids.

Now, it doesnâ€™t matter how much time I spent in writing the drama and how much
times I had to call all the actor persons together.

It is worthy.

At the last day of 2004, NIRVANA.
