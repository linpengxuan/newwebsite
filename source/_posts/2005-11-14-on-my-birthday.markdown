Couple days ago, when I held my birthday party in Pingpong room, I addressed
to my juniors, my classmates and our doctor students, never do I feel so close
to each other as brothers and sisters, never do I realize the gap between
Chinese and non-Chinese group could be narrowed down to an almost non-existent
level after European Field Study. Those are some extra benefits we gained from
the trip, which, thanks to TLBU multinational education system, also provides
us an opportunity to broad our vision abroad, refine our leadership, increase
our regional cooperation between Asia countries and our European counterparts
to a higher level. Words need no more, but thanks, Mr. President.
