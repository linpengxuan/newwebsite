My deer Pam_pam,

  
  
probably you have figured out ,ewuuu, stupid pengxuan, misspelling dear. Well
,no , that is what I meant to. You are welcome. you don't know how much we
miss u and personally how much i miss u. always said to myself, i would write
u a long letter, taking this as a consideration, you won't feel so sad when u
just get an I know from my last reply to u, as i am doing redemption
now,hahah.... i guess this is a quite cool start, isn't it? don't laugh, i
know you would agree from the bottom of ur heart.hahah....(i laugh again) i
think i am obligated to have u known what happened in France. Yes. Riots.
Hahah.... actually, we did a really good job in dealing with all our problems
including, moving in group, curfew, speaking english, even interacting with
Myungkun(i myself sacrifice my face several times to get kisses from him, now
i know his name is disgusting myungkun).... we have our friendship enhanced.
And this could probably be the first time i feel the chemistry between
brothers and sisters (I mean altogether) in TLBU, and also manage to
understand more about President and his ambition. Hope u are healthy, and you
juniors are good , thanks to me, you know. And say hello to your family if
they still remember me......ahhahahahahahahahah.. again you are welcome.
sincerely, mighty Pengxuan
