I might not worthy to receive your love, but only say the words and I should
be healed.

Thy kingdom will come. Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Give
us these days our daily bread, And forgive us our trespass, As we forgive
those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, But deliver us
from evil.

It is not an easy job to recourse the way Jesus did thousands years ago from
the Pontius Pilate’s sanction to the Calvary where he is nailed to dearth on
the cross, especially for me, a new comer eager to know the secret of
Christianity.

There are 15 stations according to the 15 times Jesus fell down during that
course. We read the liturgy each stop of the station.

I can’t say more using such words to have the situation misunderstood. It is
more about a traveling in one’s own soul. Unless you do it yourself, it will
be just like that you read something somewhere for 15 times, one can not
always knows what these mean.

Father, forgive them. For they don’t know what they are doing now.

in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. Have you heard of this
before, might be in the Churches, movies or somewhere else. Do you know what
it means. I suppose the answer is no. they call it Trinity. Kinda of being
familiar with that, you are right, the same name of that woman who save the
Neo in Matrix. Same reason about the religion implication leaking from that
movie, no wonder that Brothers want to confuse us from the ideology and
fiction. Trinity, a magic word, is all enough to explain the myth and secrecy
of the Announcement of the immaculate conception form Virgin Mary by Angel.
Indeed, it is already enough. But sorry, I know it, I DON’T WANT TO SHARE IT.
FOR those of you want to know, why not find yourself. I just don’t want to
waste another chance to enlarge your own knowledge or wake up your appetite to
know this new world which never open to China nowadays.

Same old world. I am still seeking for my belief.
