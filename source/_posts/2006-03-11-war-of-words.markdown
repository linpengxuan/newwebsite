**THAWEAT: **Fuck you i was wrong 

  

**LINPENGXUAN: why it seems that grammar is on your side when i read this mail. make me feel I wish i am wrong..  
no.nonon. you are no wrong , you are right, the rest of world is
wrong......**...

  

**THAWEAT: **Fuck you, i am not sure yet i am wrong. Possibly i am write we can use two types. Borrow sth from sb and borrow sb sth

  

**__LINPENGXUAN:__**possibly you are no write, you are right....................

__shame on......you....................................__...

  
  

**THAWEAT: **fuck you this is technical mistake. 

can we say" I wish i am right or I wish i were right

think about it man

  

**__LINPENGXUAN:I__** USE DIFFERENT GRAMMAR TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

__BTW, IT MUST BE TAKING YOU A LONG TIME TO FIND THIS OUT. ISN'T IT? __

__ANYWAY, I DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT ON IMPROVING YOUR ENGLISH.__

__SINCERELY,__

__YOURS LIGHT, ALWAYS.__

__Pengxuan Li__n

  

**THAWEAT: **don't feel upset man with your poor gramma "wish" should be used with past tense man. come on man. if i don't know i did not pick up this sentence to show you man. I saw your mistake at the first time when i checked it man. but i let it happen

  
  

__**LINPENGXUAN:**maybe you should also have an English vocaburary calss
before we move deeper..gramma or gramma__r.

  

  
**THAWEAT: **Thank you that you are interested in my spelling. It is wrong, the computer can correct but the if grammar, only God 

  

__**LINPENGXUAN:**i can say no more, you are the god__!

  

  
@page {size:21cm 29.7cm;margin:2cm;} P {margin-bottom:0.21cm;}

  

__**COMMENTS:**the moment we discussed about the issue on “can I borrow you?”,
I have to say he was honest by then. Then the war goes on. Each of us tried to
preach lesson and doctor to the other. Sometimes I would find it interesting
even read those mails after a long time! Take a close observance, that guy
started his mail with an F word. Don't know why, that turned him on, I
guess.__

  

__Actually the war of the words started from the time when we lived in campus
town, where he kept saying I was wrong about closing the light. Small mistake
yet not to be forgiven...damn it!__
