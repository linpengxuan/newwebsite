habits of million dollars.

1. it doesn't matter what you want to do, it matters when. do it now.

2. an art of knowing what and how to give up.

  
for those of you really have a lot more time than I do, you can read it. be
aware, this is none but an american antelope, jump, jump without nexus.

  
when it comes to me that I am not busy, which, unfortunetely is the case for
me all the time, I start to think about why people keep trying to gain
something, something and something more. this way left me no result, for I am
not a philosopher. but some would say that is meaning of life. shit. what is
life?

  
life is nothing but a box of chocalate, u never know what it would taste next,
but there is at least something we can do by looking the shape or the wrapper
of the chocalate, we will know it would probably made of peanuts or chusnuts
than it otherwise could be. I take that as the initialtive.

  
apparently, I am a person happen to be good at preaching something. I could
easily find a way how to solve the issue. the problem is that, I am just way
too lazy, or afraid of changing, that results in a lacking of initiative. I
means, sometimes what I need to do is take the first step, then 2nd, then
3rd... one by one till the end and voila, job is done, and usually I would
convince myself time and time again, since I already get the knowhow, do I
need to. No is a preferable answer, always.

  
retrospecting most leaders, they don't deal with disputes same way as I do,
they convince not only them but the persons around them, and they do, and do
them gung-ho.

  
ok, here comes to my first conclusion, rule 1 to make you're 1st million bucks
is it doesn't matter what you want to do, it matters when. do it now.

  
one of my very best friends, or, Miss Barbie according to her own words, asked
me not to push myself too hard. I didn't, I just cried for my own mirage,
something not impossible but diffcult. he who has more choices has no choices.
I am him.

  
frankly, I don't have a clear roadmap. sometimes I would do this, sometimes I
prefer to others. I just can't dig something out, the way I invest my time is
problematic if not crazy.

  
rule No. 2, give up something before you set out for your targets.
