I keep writing jounal all the time since high school. now blog provides a new
tool for this habit. i like to keep it, because I can say whatever I want, and
as a good source for my autobiography...

  
  
the day b4 we left from school, a feeling of losing grip suddenly got over
us....... take a look at the flower at my hand. sweat but it is withering.....

the note left my dissertation guide. a really good professor, cute and
handsome, kind-hearted. the only problem is he who named as a professor
happens not to really be interested in teaching.

my tablemate for 2 years in Korea, believe me she is far less cute in
reality...haha. but anyway, if there some guy I should thank in TLBU, she is
in the list. say, cook some food for me, tell me some dirty jokes, speaking
mandarin in a southern accent makes me feel good....
