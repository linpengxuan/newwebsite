Some sudden thoughts.

1, I got my transcripts today. It is reasonable and acceptable to me, at
least, a 3.63/4.5 is out of my expectation and far more out weighed than what
I got before in China. Still, comparing with other person, I was puzzled and
dizzy. I wonder why, those persons who spoke less in class, less participated
in class, and did less can get higher score than me. Or, the fairness in a law
school, which should be the last one to lose this dignity, is dying. One
question pondering and hovering in my head the whole afternoon. Suddenly, I am
cleared. The answer is, that is the world. Either I am one of’em, or out
of’em.

2, some kind of excitement, I am feeling now. Wanna know why? I am going to do
Presentation tomorrow. Wow, yeah, to some students, they are afraid of this
like the fire to water. For me, haha, totally the other way around. Just enjoy
that feeling when I am standing in front of all the persons, noticing them
watching me without blinking their eyes. What more do I want other than
respect? Han, baby.

3, still searching for the light in the tunnel of LSAT.

4, loophole.
