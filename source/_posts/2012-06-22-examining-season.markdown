The words "I would never ever take another exam" asserted on my graduation
of a bachelor's degree have actually been failed by me...uh...more than
once. So I failed it on my Bar exam, failed it again on various accounts in
my masters, failed it even on my term exam of Korean proficiency. I have to
say I am ready to fail more in future shamelessly.

In my case, I took some exam in finance on early June and I am now also
going for yet another challenge, iBT. The clock is ticking, I have only 10
days left for preparation. And to my sadness, it is way more difficult than
I thought it would be. I took it 10 years ago in paper test, to be frankly,
it wasn't difficult and I scored well. I was holding belief that it was not
going to change that much in 10 years time as babies don't change their
ways of linguistic learning in such short period. I was wrong. ETS turned
out to be not an pro-Chinese anymore.

Anyway, I am always the victim of my own ambitions, if any. I acknowledge
that it is not easy. I will conquer it. Hmm, like, the way I play
Civilization III.

I finally took the exam. It wasn't that difficult. Actually I was thinking about postponing it because I wasn't able to do well in listening section, still remember the incident, score 4 errors in just 2 parts. Been good enough to destroy my confidence. Wasn't able to postpone it, for the reason of policy restriction. That was the time 2 days away from testing date.

So you could find me rather upset about this. Should I, or should I not take it. Just like to be or not to be.

I have maintained good traditions of missing some informations on the exam. For example, I remember the wrong date for my CFA test. I made no exceptions this time either. Firstly, I mistook the testing place as Sogang University while the real one is Sogang College, it was so material that going to wrong place means you can't make it to the right one before the reporting time. I also prestinely missed the bus stop, it was the routine route I go for work, I had to walk back in the heavy raining weather. Half of my shirts were wet.

None of these prevent me from enthusiatically taking exam. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed. Reading is ok, but listening part is the long format, which means there are experimental conversations that don't get graded, yet we don't know what they are.

One more thing to mention is the screen. I have this eye stressing problem. I felt tired if I look at the LCD for too long a time. The case here is worse, they use old CRT screen for testing, apparently my registration fee was not invested in upgrading the equipment here.

I thought I did good in Reading, Writing, less well in Listening and Speaking. I can assure an above 100. We will see it in 2 weeks later.

I am always busy. See, I have to make a plan for my trip to Turkey 2 weeks later. Have to grab some basics of its language.:)
