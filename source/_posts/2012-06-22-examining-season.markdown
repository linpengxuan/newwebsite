The words "I would never ever take another exam" asserted on my graduation
of a bachelor's degree have actually been failed by me...uh...more than
once. So I failed it on my Bar exam, failed it again on various accounts in
my masters, failed it even on my term exam of Korean proficiency. I have to
say I am ready to fail more in future shamelessly.

In my case, I took some exam in finance on early June and I am now also
going for yet another challenge, iBT. The clock is ticking, I have only 10
days left for preparation. And to my sadness, it is way more difficult than
I thought it would be. I took it 10 years ago in paper test, to be frankly,
it wasn't difficult and I scored well. I was holding belief that it was not
going to change that much in 10 years time as babies don't change their
ways of linguistic learning in such short period. I was wrong. ETS turned
out to be not an pro-Chinese anymore.

Anyway, I am always the victim of my own ambitions, if any. I acknowledge
that it is not easy. I will conquer it. Hmm, like, the way I play
Civilization III.
